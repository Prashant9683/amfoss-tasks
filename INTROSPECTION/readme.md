# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I think it's a difficult question for me as I'm a noob. My father once told me that when a person does things of his interests, only then he becomes successful. Then i started looking for what doing makes me happy. I found that programming is the only thing that will make me happy. I get bored in games too but I never get bored doing this. I started learning C language, It was difficult to me but i never got bored of doing that. I installed kali linux also to learn ethical hacking but due to lack of proper guidance, I couldn't learn that much. Now I'm pretty sure that this club will help me to make it happen. This club is the only reason I'm in this college.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I don't know much in tech field but I want to be a problem solver. I want to learn programming languages. I just want to keep doing coding for the rest of my life. But for the next 6 months, I'll focus on solve problems and see how things happen. I also want to keep full focus on my GPA so that I can upgrade my branch from ELC to CSE in next year.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
Well this is the question to which I can say with full confidence that whatever the club wants me to do, I will do with all my efforts. I expect that this club will use me to the fullest and take me out from my comfort zone. It'll make me best.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No the selection process is the best i have ever seen.This selection process gives a great learning experience to whosoever who attempt the 
tasks.I was amazed to see what my progress was because of these tasks in one month so i personally find the selection process very ethical.
