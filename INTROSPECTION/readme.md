# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I think it's a difficult question for me as I'm a noob. My father once told me that when a person does things of his interests, only then he becomes successful. Then i started looking for what doing makes me happy. I found that programming is the only thing that will make me happy. I get bored in games too but I never get bored doing this. I started learning C language, It was difficult to me but i never got bored of doing that. I installed kali linux also to learn ethical hacking but due to lack of proper guidance, I couldn't learn that much. Now I'm pretty sure that this club will help me to make it happen. This club is the only reason I'm in this college.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I don't know much in tech field but I want to be a problem solver. I want to learn programming languages. I just want to keep doing coding for the rest of my life. But for the next 6 months, I'll focus on solve problems and see how things happen. I also want to keep full focus on my GPA so that I can upgrade my branch from ELC to CSE in next year.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
Well this is the question to which I can say with full confidence that whatever the club wants me to do, I will do with all my efforts. I expect that this club will use me to the fullest and take me out from my comfort zone. It'll make me best.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I never took part in any selection process so I'm not able to give feedback but this selection process is just wow. It is at it's peak because whoever wants to be a part of this club, this selection process prepares them to face challanges in advance.
