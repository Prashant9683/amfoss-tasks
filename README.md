## My views about the tasks
I had faced many challenges as i was new to programming. I only learned basic of C and C++ before. All these tasks are really complicated for a beginner i think. Well every task had resources with it for some help but still i was unable to do those tasks without the help of Google and Youtube. But these tasks were just amaze for me. I highely appreciate to this selection process. It's all about take challenges. And I'm glad to see myself outside my comfort zone. I have never done any work except study with so much heart.
## My Introduction
Hello! I'm Prashant Gehlot and my native place is Jalore,Rajasthan(India). I was in love with tech field since my childhood. I always wondered how all these things happened in computers(like websites, games etc). Then it came to my knowledge that it's all about programming languages. I decided to explore these things. I found on quora that amFOSS club is one of the best tech club in south india. So i decided to take admission into deemed university Amrita vishwa vidyapeetham. I am not that good into coding as I only learned C language and made a website in html with the help of Google itself. I probably bet that the amFOSS club will help me to understand how these things happen and will make me a problem solver. There's a saying, "The person can do better in the field in which the person is interested". I'm interested in it so I can say with full confidence that I'll put all my efforts to learn.
