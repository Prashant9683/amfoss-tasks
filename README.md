## My views about the tasks
I myself have not completed all the tasks so i cannot directly say that they were easy but yaa they were not of that type that they 
would be out of the range of freshers.They were so amazing that i cannot have a particular word to describe them.They challange us to 
increase our knowledge that is the best part of it.The tasks are designed to cultivate the habit of self learning in which they are 
successful atleast in my case.
## My Introduction
Hello! I'm Prashant Gehlot and my native place is Jalore,Rajasthan(India). I was in love with tech field since my childhood. I always wondered how all these things happened in computers(like websites, games etc). Then it came to my knowledge that it's all about programming languages. I decided to explore these things. I found on quora that amFOSS club is one of the best tech club in south india. So i decided to take admission into deemed university Amrita vishwa vidyapeetham. I am not that good into coding as I only learned C language and made a website in html with the help of Google itself. I probably bet that the amFOSS club will help me to understand how these things happen and will make me a problem solver. There's a saying, "The person can do better in the field in which the person is interested". I'm interested in it so I can say with full confidence that I'll put all my efforts to learn.
