# 3. Programming

The problems were at the very high level. I could solved some problems because I usually participate in codechef and codeforces contests.. So i was just a noob to solve these but i tried at least to solve them. But this is the 3rd thing which i liked very much after flutter and js explore. First i thought it would be boring but then i started liking to solve these problems.
