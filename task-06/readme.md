# Flutter based UI task

This was the most interesting, challenging and difficult task. I took the help of YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/j-LOab_PzzU) to do this but i was just desperate to do this task. I did not want to leave it because the desire to make my first android or ios app kept me on this task.
