**Hello everyone**, It is my first personal website using ruby.

## My views about amFOSS tasks-

I've learned many things and stuffs from these tasks. These tasks are just next level. I didn't do anything like this till now so i am very excited about this. I faced challenges, I failed sometimes, I faced many errors. But I were happy doing this and I understood now that this is the thing I'll be doing my whole life without getting bore. Maybe I'll not be selected in amFOSS club. But still I'll be very happy and I'll be doing same things with same confidence. Thank you so much amFOSS! You tought me many lessons without taking me in.

At last, I can say that these tasks are amazing.
