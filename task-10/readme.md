# CS50
I've gone through all the lectures and i tried solving problems. I did as much as i can. First i took lecture 6 since i was very familiar with python. Then i solved problems in python. I couldn't do it in C so i did in python. Hope you'll accept it. If you won't accept still i'll be happy that i solved problems at least.
